# Recipes with Hooks

This is a WIP exercise using `React Hooks`, `Async/Await`, and `Sass` to make API calls to Edaman and receive and render recipe information. The user will enter their search in the form and it will render titles, images, a list of ingredients, calories, and serving amount.

I worked on this to practice shifting over to `React Hooks` rather than class-based components.
